#### _Three Stage Course Material Project - Restaurant Reviews_

## Project Overview: Stage 3

My goal was to convert a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application. It considers full web-a11y features such as screen readers, voiceover, and keyboard tab support. You can get reviews for restaurants on a single page, with the option to add your own reviews. All screens are supported. 

## Prerequisites

Install Udacity server from github and install it per the instructions. It must be set up on the same host that you will be running the page from (which is not required to be localhost). Once installed, start it as described in the README.

Make sure you have Python installed.

## Running the webapp:

To run the webapp on your local machine, run these commands:

```
npm install
cd app
node server.js
```
